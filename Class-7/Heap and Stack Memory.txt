Heap and Stack Memory:

*Heap memory is shared by every method.
*Every method has it's own stack.
*All primitive datatypes and all the local variables will get stored in Stack.
*Objects will get stored in Heap.

EXAMPLE:

*if we store an integer, it will be stored in stack.
*if we have a class Student and create a object 's' then the object/reference variable  will be stored in heap.
