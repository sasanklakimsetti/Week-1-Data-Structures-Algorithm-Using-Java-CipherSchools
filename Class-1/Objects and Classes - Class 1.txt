Object Oriented Programming(OOPS):

*Based on real world.
*Program is divided into small parts called Objects.
*follows bottom up approach.
*Data is given more importance than functions.
*Data hiding is possible and hence more secure.
*Adding new data and function is much easier.
*Ex : C++, Java, Python, C#,etc.


What are Objects?

*Anything that has a state and behaviour is known as object.
*Objects can be physical/logical.
*It is a real-world entity.
*It is an instance of a class.


What are Classes?

*A class is a group of objects which have common properties.
*A class can be seen as a blueprint from which objects are created.
*For example: A car can be a class and we can have various objects. Each car object has attributes(properties) such as weight and color and methods(behaviour) such as accelerate and brake.

*Classes can contain: 
			Fields
			Methods
			Constructors
			Nested class and interface

*Creation of object of a class(Instantiation of a class):
				known as instantiation of a class
	objects share the attributes and the behaviour of the class
	values of those attributes may be unique for each object
	A class may have any number of instances.
