Abstraction 

*Data Abstraction is the process of hiding certain details and showing only essential information to the user.
*Ex: We know all cars must accelerate, brake, blow horn,etc. But we don't know what exactly happens when we press the accelerator, how the acceleration will be achieved. This is called Abstraction.
*Abstraction can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.

Abstract Method:

*Method declared but not implemented is called abstract method.
*abstract methods do not have a body but terminate with a semicolon.
*The keyword 'abstract' must be used in the signature of the method.
*final and static methods can't be declared abstract.

Abstract Class:
*Class containing abstract methods is called abstract class. Keyword 'abstract' must be used in the class declaration, else compiler will throw an error.
*Abstract class can' be instantiated.

syntax: abstract classname{ }

*Abstract methods are used to force the subclasses to provide the implementation by defining the body.
*If any subclass doesn't implement all the abstract methods of parent class, it will also be treated as abstract.

*If the class has implementations of methods and not an abstract class, it is said to be concrete class.
*An abstract class can have concrete methods but still can't be instantiated i.e. object can't be created.
