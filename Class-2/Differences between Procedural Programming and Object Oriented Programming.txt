Differences between Procedural Programming and Object Oriented Programming:

Procedural Programming:

*Derived from structural programming.
*Program is divided into small parts called functions.
*follows top down approach.
*function is more important than data.
*based on unreal world.
*no proper way fro hiding data, so it is less secure.
*adding new data and function is not easy.
*ex: C, Fortran, Pascal, Basic, etc.

Object Oriented Programming(OOPS)

*based on real world.
*Program is divided into small parts called objects.
*Object Oriented Programming follows bottom up approach.
*Data is given more importance than functions.
*Data hiding is possible and hence more secure.
*Adding new data and function is much easier.
Ex: C++, Java, Python, C#, etc
