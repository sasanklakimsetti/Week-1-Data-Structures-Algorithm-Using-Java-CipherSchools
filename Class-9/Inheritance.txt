Inheritance:

*The property of an object to acquire all the properties and behaviour of its parent object.
*Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as parent-child relationship.

ex: Parent - Animal
      Child - Mammals, Reptiles, Amphibians

*Child class always inherits properties from Parent class.

*Advantages: Code reusabilty, extensibility, overriding, data hiding

*Syntax:   class Child extends Parent{
         		//	
	       	      //
         	}

*Types: Single, Hierarchial, Multiple, Multilevel

*Multiple inheritance doesn't support in Java because java can't solve diamond problem as there are no virtual classes.
